    <h1>Lunar new years</h1>
    <p>Lunar New Year is the beginning of a new year based on lunar calendars or, informally but more widely, lunisolar calendars. Typically, both types of calendar begin with a new moon but, whilst a lunar calendar year has a fixed number (usually twelve) of lunar months, lunisolar calendars have a variable number of lunar months, resetting the count periodically to resynchronise with the solar year. The event is celebrated by numerous cultures in various ways at diverse dates. The determination of the first day of a new lunar or lunisolar year varies by culture.

        In 2023, the United Nations General Assembly designated the Lunar New Year as a UN holiday, recognizing the spring festival that coincides with the Chinese New Year and is also celebrated in China, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and Korea among others. Some states in the US, including California and New York, officially celebrate the Lunar New Year as a public holiday in recognition of the Chinese New Year.
        
        The better-known celebrations include new years based on the (lunar) Islamic calendar and the (lunisolar) Jewish calendar that originated in the Middle East; the (lunisolar) Chinese calendar and Tibetan calendar of East Asia;[1][2][3] and the (lunisolar) Buddhist and Hindu calendars of Southeast and South Asia.</p>
