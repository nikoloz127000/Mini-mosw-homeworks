#algorithms --> step by step done instructions togetherness


# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(50,150):
#     print(i)

# for loops are used to repeat some operation in a certain amount
# true and false wll display false because were telling the input to do two things at the same time since it wont work it will display false
# true or false will display true because were telling it to choose betweene true or false and it will always pick true because it has an option to choose
